/* Q25. A security system generates list of prime keys within given range. Implement a solution to display all
prime numbers between two limits.
A web-based application enforces strong password policies during user registration to improve account security.
The system requires that every password must satisfy the following conditions:
• Contain at least one uppercase letter (A–Z)
• Contain at least one lowercase letter (a–z)
• Contain at least one digit (0–9)
• Contain at least one special character from the set
@ # $ % ! & *
You are required to develop the code so that the password validation logic can be implemented in the application*/
